## Face Recognition Attendance Tracker
This project involves a face recognition attendance system that detect and recognize faces in real time. It utilizes [Pytorch FaceNet](https://github.com/timesler/facenet-pytorch) Model (MTCNN & Inception Resnet) to extract facial embeddings, which are then matched against stored embeddings using cosine similarity via MongoDBâ€™s vector search to identify the most similar face in the database. The users attendance is then marked as present in the database.
